<h1>Interests</h1>
<hr />
<p>My life has been an adventure driven by a passion for staying active and exploring the world. From the rush of carving through fresh powder on a snowboard to riding the waves beneath the warm sun, I thrive on the exhilaration of physical pursuits. Traveling has been my greatest teacher, allowing me to embrace diverse cultures, languages, and landscapes.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my journey was spending two unforgettable years living overseas in Canada, indulging in the thrill of a snow season. The crisp mountain air and the camaraderie with fellow snow enthusiasts left me with cherished memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Equally memorable was my four-month stint working at a surf camp in Colares, Portugal. The blend of teaching eager surfers, sharing beachfront bonfires, and immersing myself in the laid-back Portuguese lifestyle created an experience that truly enriched my life.</p>
<p>Music has always been the soundtrack to my adventures, bringing people together in joyful harmony. Problem-solving, another of my passions, challenges me to continually seek innovative solutions, whether it's conquering a challenging wave or unraveling a complex coding dilemma. Socializing, for me, is about connecting with others, forging bonds over shared experiences and making lifelong friends.</p>
<p>My life revolves around these passions, and they have shaped me into the adventurous and adaptable individual I am today. </p>
